Run the game load any character or make a new one.

A cardname.bones.txt file will be created in the character card dir.

Move the sliders around and see your changes in realtime.

## Customization
You may edit the bone names and groups in the XML file to suit your needs.

## Known Issues
Due to the nature of updating the text file while using the sliders you might occasionally get a save failed due to collision. Ignore it and move a slider again to resave.

Currently Koikatu ABM_v0.7.0 stops reloading the bones file from time to time after saving a character. To make it update it - reload the character card.
